Richard Smith,5,Great Rates and Easy to Set Up,"I had some cash earning next to nothing in an HSBC Flexsaver account and transferred it into Atom, which had the best rate I could find. Very easy to set up. No clunky legacy systems like the old banks. I had a problem of my own making in that I had an existing log in from very early in Atom's life when I helped at Durham University with facial recognition testing. That needed unlocking before I could use it but the call centre was really helpful and clear and it was all sorted whilst I was on the phone. These guys are really serious about their customers."

Would have liked to be able to print out confirmation of account details (amount/date paid/interest rate) right away but this document only became available after the 'closing date' for adding money to the account.
Nick Saul,5,None of this half an hour to open…,None of this half an hour to open account and then waiting to receive more nonsense through the post. You just open the account. That's all any customer wants. But it's as safe as all the other banks that treat you like you're 6. I love Atom bank but I'm sad you just reduced your rates on bonds as I wanted to open another one.
Terry Ramrattan,3,Low interest rate,Easy to set up. Easy to access. Easy to transfer money in and out….But! The rate of interest is below most other institutions and recommendations therefore I transferred all money out into a higher interest rate bank!

KT,5,Simple straightforward and good interest…,I’m really pleased with my Atom fixed term deposit account. It was easy to open - the security looks good and the app is very straightforward to use.

Liam,4,Strong rates on fixed savings however…,Strong rates on fixed savings however slightly behind on easy access rates. Nice smooth app and simple to use. Recommended to family and friends. 👍
Someone in IT Security,1,KNOWN SECURITY EXPLOIT!!!!,"The app has a bespoke ""FaceID"" feature (I'm not referring to the iPhone FaceID hardware) which uses the front camera to check if you match the photo you uploaded when creating the account.The bespoke FaceID feature cannot be disabled which allows someone to login by simply putting any publicly available photograph they find of you in front of the camera (which I have been able to replicate and have reported to the ICO as a breach of reasonable security and GDPR).Incredibly bad practice, massive security flaw and not acceptable by modern standards especially from a banking app. Made worse by the fact that I reported this to Atom and they said it was fine?!?! (despite the fact that I walked them through how I was able to bypass their login screen without ever needing to be present at the device).This feature should not exist, leave FaceID up to the experts, you are a bank, you don't know what you are doing."

Carolanne,1,Terrible customer service and app dodgy app,Initially found the experience to be good and placed my savings in this account but then it all went downhill.Got to the end of my fixed saver and decided to pick another one before the deadline. It said that you had the option until a certain time the day before to change your mind. So I then realised that I could get a better rate with someone else so I went back on the app and clicked on the withdraw to bank account option. It got to the Monday and I realised they had in fact went ahead and opened the new fixed saver anyway despite choosing this option on time.I then phoned customer service and spoke to someone whose manager declined to give me my savings back despite literally phoning and explaining the situation 8 hours After the deadline and what had gone wrong. I then asked the advisor to open a complaint. Hours after this I got a generic final response stating there terms and conditions completely ignoring the fact something went wrong on there system and what I had explained it wasn't that I was asking for my money back because I suddenly changed my mind. So my money is now stuck in a two year fixed saver that I didn't want in the first place.Do not give them your money as there customer serving is terrible and they just act like robots with computer says no answers without actually taking into consideration the situation. You can also tell the advisor didn't even listen on the phone when doing there final response as they made no mention of what had actually happened. Just gave me terms and conditions jargon.

JF - Herts,4,Good and Easy to use.,"I have several accounts with ATOM, both Fixed Savings and Instant account.  Good rates of interest and easy to use and set up.My only gripe, stopping a 5* review, when the fixed rate account matures there is no option to move it into an already open fixed rate account.   The only options are transfer to another new account to to the external connected account."

Roy Stone,5,Keeping it simple,Having been frustrated by easily avoidable problems or been presented with complicated procedures when trying to invest money in the past in my experience there are a few companies that keep things as simple as possible whilst still offering a good return on your investment and in my opinion atom is well worth a visit. 👍👍

I also had to follow up with a phone call that was answered within a few minutes. The helpline person was UK based, very friendly and intelligent."

B Smith,5,The company is always there with…,The company is always there with support I feel secure with them
STUART GILES,5,Loyalty no longer exists with HSBC,"After being with my bank for over 30 years, and have never had a problem with them, I have sold my business, and left my savings with them, earning absolutely pittance. the only reassurance is that my bank is a sturdy stable corporation. Realising I’m loyal to them, but how loyal are they to me. So I’ve decided to nearly double my interest rate with Atom bank. I could further better rates with Atom, by fixing my term with them from an instant access to a fixed term, but are hoping that rates will be better over the next 3/6 months so I can fix further monies. Opening an account was a breeze, what I like, is whet I call end 2 end. From my bank account to my new Atom account, when I withdraw its back to my original account and nowhere else."
Robert Smith,5,Atom bank…,"With a good interest rate being offered I downloaded their app, it is very easy to navigate around with some great investments on offer.They are quick to inform you of any activities with your accounts, and I have moved my savings from a high street bank to them, and would highly recommend them."

Greg,1,Very unethical & putting children at risk,"- I was issued with an approval for a mortgage with Atom Bank on a property 3 months ago.- As we neared the Completion Date, my solicitor checked via the mortgage portal whether everything was going alright one week ago; he received a positive response stating that he needed to carry out his due diligence as a professional solicitor to ensure that the property met the Bank's lending criteria.- I also contacted the bank on the same day (one week ago) via the chat facility on the app, asking when the mortgage process will be concluded. I received a positive answer, stating that my application was fine, and the only remaining step was for my solicitor to provide the Contract Of Title for the new property. I am in possession of the transcript of this conversation, as proof of my conversation.- Given that all criteria had been met, my solicitor proceeded to request funds from the bank today. - Only at this point was my solicitor told by the bank that they would not proceed with the application. They also refused to give any reasoning, nor tell my solicitor why this hadn't been communicated earlier.- Then, my broker got in touch with the bank: he was abruptly told that the bank would not proceed with the application, but once again, no reasons, nor justification for such late timing was given.- We have three children who need to start school on 4th September, and yet, we are now facing a situation where we do not have a property to live in.- It is absolutely disgusting how they can act like this, and yet claim to be a professionally run bank.- If this is not favourably resolved, I will begin the complaints process with the Financial Ombudsmen, to whom I will be providing all written communication that we have received from the bank which helps to back-up my claims."

You can only apply, setup and manage the account via their app. While this process and overall management of the account is very good, the app seems to be a little fickle, particularly when setting up the facial recognition and subsequently using this method to access the account. I am finding that it is easier to use the passcode access option. However, their interest rate is very good and lodging funds into the account was very quick and easy."

However, the sign up process doesn't reveal this until after you have already filled in your personal details. So now, in addition to wasting my time, I've also given Atom Bank my personal details for nothing. They should warn you that they are a Big Brother app BEFORE they collect your personal details. I will caution everyone that Atom Bank are a Big Brother company, and due to a lack of pre-emptive transparency, they don't make this apparent until after they already have your personal details."

From mid-August, you won’t be able to access the app unless you upgrade your operating system to a newer version.I replied with this:-My iPhone cannot be upgraded to IOS14, which means I will no longer have access to the app from mid-August. I do not intend to spend thousands boosting Apple’s already obscene profits buying a new phone just because you lot can’t be arsed to write backwards-compatible software.So you have de-banked me.They wrote back and said it was my duty to ensure that my phone was compatible with whatever software they chose to enable their app. They do not have a laptop option, only a phone app. As far as I'm concerned, they've de-banked me and are insincere untrustworthy. Make your own judgment but they get no more of my money."

This could be because your connection is patchy or because too many people are trying to log on.'Appalling! It's no excuse that they've raised their rates and are getting a lot more applications. You should NEVER have anticipated circumstances like that  preventing customers accessing their accounts.You don't get Amazon saying you can't have access because too many people are using the app.If you can't provide an app that allows customers 24-hour acces to their money, then don't come to market with higher interest rates until you can!"

KerryK,5,"Safe, secure and hassle free","Very impressed with my experience of Atom Bank. Not a name I was familiar with, but I looked into them after seeing the name mentioned on Martin Lewis (money saving expert) while looking for a good savings account. I did all of the necessary checks to make sure all was legit and covered by FSCS security, and felt confident in opening an account. Whilst it took less than 15 minutes online, the levels of personal security were exceptional (voice/face and password). The account was instantly recognised by my high street bank as I made the first small transfer to check all ok, and I’ve not looked back. Safe, secure, hassle free and a great interest rate. I’m so impressed I’ve since helped my husband open an account, and my sister has, too. Very happy."

Andrew Lee,1,UK Homebuyers be Warned: Atom Bank Unreasonably Preventing My Property to be Registered under My Name,"I bought a house last year (2022) and the transaction was completed in April 2022 but as of July 2023 the application to change the title holder to my name with Land Registry still cannot be completed. The reason: the bloody Atom Bank still has NOT released its charge on the property. And according to my solicitor, other land conveyance works that they've done that require Atom Bank releasing its charge are all like that. So, it appears this is an institutional issue with Atom Bank, and not an issue with a certain individual within it. It's been bloody 15 months since I paid for my property and still Atom Bank hasn't release its charge on it. This is utterly ridiculous and absolutely unacceptable. If I could give a ZERO in Trustpilot I definitely would! I strongly advise any homebuyers in the UK to enquire beforehand if Atom Bank has a charge on the property they want to buy. If yes, think twice!"
MEB,1,My wife tried to open a savings account…,My wife tried to open a savings account with Atom but as they use some Mickey Mouse credit agency to check applicants she was refused an account.

C H,5,Couldn't recommend more,"I've been a customer for over 4 years now and I've not encountered a single issue. I track the interest rates and monitor my savings quite often, and Atom have been consistently competitive. They are one of the only banks that have actually passed the high interets rates to their savers, rather than pocketing all the profit. The app is great, it's easy to use, and the linked account makes it simple and safe to withdraw money immediately.  I hope Atom continue to operate as they do, as I will happily be a customer for life."

Bondy,3,Transferring Between Accounts Not Possible,"I'm sure it is buried somewhere in the terms and conditions, but if you open a second savings account you cannot transfer between them, even if they are in the same name, within the App. In this instance you have to transfer back and forth to the linked external account. They are apparently working on it, which at least acknowledges they know they have a problem. I agree the account is easy to open, but it is not as flexible as it ought to be."
Zoe Simpson,4,Easy to open and use,"Very good customer service, I encountered no problems using the App. However once you open the account and put your money in that’s it, you cannot get it out till maturity! So maybe look around first for a better interest rate, which I should have done!!"

Live chat wasn't interested, they just told me to call. The person on the phone also not interested and the only help they could offer was to leave it a few days and try again.After waiting and trying again, i gave up and opened an account with Oak North. Took 5 minutes online and had my money transferred within the hour. Thats how it should work Atom.Highly reccommend Oak North if you're having trouble getting Atom to work."

Paul. S.  Northampton,5,"Atom Bank newbie, check them out",I chose Atom Bank after reading reviews and comparison sites.  I liked the idea of a UK based bank.  Registering online was really easy and I consider the online security set up comprehensive and reassuring.  I provisionally only invested a nominal amount to 'test the water' and I saw the transaction was complete and my new account was open.  I then transferred further funds.  Everything was easy and quick.  I was slightly concerned about the deposit 'window' period but my concerns were unfounded.  Some online banks offer marginally higher rates of interest but I feel comfortable using Atom Bank.

It was not made clear you need to press and HOLD the big button while it is collecting your image. The finger print login worked a couple of times then stopped being available.

Lew G,5,Flexible and transparent,"Have used atom for for a few years now and very impressed. Deposits start attracting interest immediately and when accounts mature the money is available on the same day to withdraw or re invest. i.e theres no 'holding account' that some banks or third party platforms deploy to hold onto your cash for days longer without interest.  Interest rates are good and often top the tables. Very flexible indeed, with a choice of fixed terms.  Interest can be added monthly or annually and can be paid to the Atom account or paid to the linked bank account. You can even specify which day of the month you wish interest to be paid,  All this can make a difference if you are trying to juggle tax issues.The app works well and is clear. Ive only had to contact telephone support once and my query was quickly answered,"

It took me five twenty minute phone calls to transfer money into the account online from my current account though. I got to know the staff at the fraud office well. But even after telling them I’d done my due diligence via reviews, the FCA, Companies House and a cousin at Special Branch it was still tricky in larger amounts so I’d recommend depositing big sums in branch or over the phone."

Samuel Stephens,3,I wanted to take out a 1 year fixed…,"I wanted to take out a 1 year fixed saver account at the competitive interest rate of 5.95%. On registration which, was very easy to complete, I clicked on ""The fixed saver"" option, this took me to a number of pages of info on the product etc. However, when it came to selecting ""choose a Fixed Saver"" using the purple button at the bottom of the page, this took me to ""our 6 Month Fixed Saver"" option. Yes there wete plus and minus buttons to change the amount of investment option but I didn't know how to get to the other options such 1, 2, 3 or 5 year fixed options. After chatting with the help desk (after creating a 6 month account I might add), I now know that you have to swipe across to see these other options. For info Atom, this would have been useful to have known that by stating that in the pre-amble. In summary Atom, don't assume everyone knows how to use your App, particularly new customers. I've ended up with 2 x 6 month accounts for now, and the Jury is it out to see how it goes!"

Syed,1,Janky verification process,"For a bank that prides itself for being app only, the verification process is terrible. I sent in photo ID to ensure my details matched and they still couldn't verify me for a fixed saver and they couldn't even tell me the reason why. Wth? Never had this issue with other banks, especially as I sent in my passport ID. More importantly, it seems to be an issue customer service can't solve... fair enough honestly, will just go somewhere else."

I have been with Atom now for 4 years having a fixed rate saver account for 12 months each time. The rates offered this year are obviously much better than previous and I’m happy to keep my money with Atom, as I can log in and watch it grow and know it’s secure. When the time comes to withdraw it, I know I can do that no problem, but for me right now it’s safely making me more until I need it. I’ve previously contacted customer service, I’d changed my phone and was struggling with the accessibility but they were great and helped me sort it out. Would definitely recommend Atom bank. Just wish they did fixed rate ISA as well 😉"

Nigel Lester,1,Tried again to open a fixed rate…,Tried again to open a fixed rate interest account. Forgot how painful this was the previous time but was reminded when I started going through the process. Was confronted by server connection issues. Long story short have given up as I cannot sign up. That's 30 minutes I wont get back.
John,5,Opened a fixed deposit account with Atom today,After much soul searching and research I just closed my premium bond account with NS&I and opened a fixed deposit account with Atom.  The account opening process was efficient took no more than 15 minutes.  My first deposit was received into my new account within minutes.
Thomas Washuus,4,Good but interest logic doesn't add up,"The app is intuitive. The interest rate is fantastic and the signup process is easy and quick. The customer service team is quick to get back to you if you have questions or doubts.It is not getting 5 stars because you can get a fixed savings account and the interest rate will be locked even during your deposit window. The loophole is that you need to wait till the very last day or hours before the deadline to decide if they are offering a better rate or not. If they do offer a better rate, the rate can't be changed on your account. However, you can choose to not deposit money and the account will be closed. You then just create a new account with a better rate they offer.It seems very illogical and would just be easier if they provide a chance for the customer to upgrade the interest rate whilst the deposit window remains open.I was made aware that interest is accrued daily, so waiting will lose you 6 days' worth of interest but in my instance getting a 0.10% potential increase in interest is still more than 6 days of lost interest. Even if you lose 6 days it is basically next to none over the course of the fixed savings account.If there is a next time with Atom, this is the approach I will take."
M Jones,5,The whole process of opening an account…,The whole process of opening an account was very quick and easy. Very happy. I would definitely recommend.
Veronica,1,Utter Waste of Time and Money,"Wanted to open a fixed rate account earlier, after opening, needed get a certified copy of my passport and then post to them by snail mail which is quite a hassle already. Then they ask for proof of Indefinite Leave to Remain, I'm an UK resident on a visa, if they only allow citizens or ILR holders to apply for the account, which is ridiculous in itself (all other banks only require someone opening account to be resident and adult), they should certainly make this clear on their website and also ask this question in the form for opening an account, don't waste people's time and money by adding additional eligibility criteria later."
Britt,5,They are good overall,"They are really good, compared to other online- only banks,  app is really easy to use never had issue, transfer is instant,  UK based customer service available 7 days a week and super helpful as well , I just wish they would keep up with the market interest rate a bit better ( as at the moment,  their interest rate is not as competitive compared to other Internet based bank) apart from the interest rate, everything else is great"
Customer,5,Great experience!,"Amazing! Really happy with everything!I feel a little anxious when I transfer money from my HSBC bank account to Atom, but the notification comes through immediately and before the HSBC ‘money out’ notification!The current interest rate is great!Thank you!"
Mr Bassey,5,Brilliant app and Communication !!,"To be honest, up until about 2 weeks ago I had never heard of Atom Bank / Digital Mortgages and when my mortgage broker advised he has sourced me a mortgage with this lender I was a little apprehensive. On submitting my application i immediately got an email and text from Atom advising of the next steps and how to download their app to my smartphone which I did. Since downloading the app, I have been kept up to date with every development and they have kept all of my documents in a very handy vault so you can go back to them at any point. The valuation was done within days and a copy placed in my vault for clarity. Its refreshing to see a lender that has its customers needs at its forefront and the communication i have received since day one has been superb. Brilliant service and the app is exceptionally easy to navigate around. Keep up the good work Atom !!"

Jordan,5,I currently have a 1-year fixed rate…,"I currently have a 1-year fixed rate Bond and instant-access savings account with Atom. At first, on my search for the appropriate bank to place my savings in I was worried about the lack of transparency on various websites, the caveats of what happens to your money if you forgot to submit instructions upon the bond maturing, the small prints in their terms and conditions, which include caveats. However, with Atom this was not the case. You can see how transparent they are on their website and when I rang their customer service line, every person I spoke to was knowledgeable and professional, patient and polite. This gave me trust. I actually fixed at 4:35% with Atom when their were banks offering  4.5% at the time, and the reason for that is because I value transparency and trust far when placing large amounts of cash into a bank, over 0.15% extra in terms of a savings rate. Trust me their app is amazing. other banks I spoke to via phone had no idea what I was talking about when I questioned them on their terms and conditions of their fixed rate bonds and most told me to wait on the line while they pulled up the document up on their screen. This was LOYDS, Virgin etc. Atom knew from the first moment I started asking them questions about their T&C’s what I was on about. Hope this helps. I rate them."

I moved my savings to Atom Bank from my high street bank who I have been a customer of since 1972 because they were not giving decent interest rates.

Anne Gale,1,Losing out on better rate,I’ve been a customer of Atom for 3 year. This week opened my 3rd fixed saver to reinvest my savings. Two days after opening and within the deposit window the interest rate changed … atom will not honour the new rate. If the deposit window had closed I would accept it but think their rules are unfair. Sadly this will be my last time with Atom … shame really

Very responsive and nice app.  Lately though the rate has become very low against the competition. Monzo instant access, for example, is paying a lot more.

Even though I selected my address from the drop down menu, it was not recognised and halted the application process. After I had worked my way round this, I answered all the credit check questions correctly and then had to wait another day for further checks to be completed. Once the account was opened it only then tells you that you have a 7 day window to fund the account. Great rate but I felt whole application process could have been simpler!Amended from a 1 star review."

Wont use you again - dont know how you can send a message saying new rate will be applied then after clarify to mean something else! Blatant misrepresentationI had a 6mth saver maturing and as the BOE had just raised rates I wasn’t sure whether to open another 6mths fixed saver until Atom put the rate up. I got a message from Atom to say any rate rise would be applied to the new saver so i opened the account and put my money in. Guess what? They didnt apply the increase and when I contacted them they fobbed me off with the usual terms and conditions rubbish, wouldnt let me close the account either as no cooling off period - very underhand and disreputable in my opinion - as soon as this saver matures i will never use atom again - withdrew all monies from instant saver too for a better rate elsewhere."

My experience was totally different. I could not verify my account with them on their app and the reasons given to me were as follows...[12/05, 08:51] : We get our information from a credit reference agency called Transunion you may want to check with them what details they hold on yourself and check it is up to date.[12/05, 08:52] : It may be many reasons you can not be verified such as if you have moved address recently or if you do not have a very thick credit file or you may not been on the electoral register.I was literally shocked. I am an Indian origin who is living in UK at same address from two years. I have worked here, I have National Insurance Number and I already have accounts with well known high street banks. On the top of that I wanted to invest my money and I was not asking to get money from Atom bank. Total waste of time in my opinion. I will not suggest anyone to think of investing with them.While registering on app I had to use my face photo and my voice was recorded 3 times for confirming my identity. When I requested them to delete all my data I was told that Atom bank can hold some of the information for 7 years by law.I never knew investing my money could be that hard. Atom bank it's your loss.

customer,1,Further update to how shockingly bad…,Further update to how shockingly bad this company is. On the back of my previous review I was asked to contact atom so they could raise a complaint and investigate why my affordability was so low!Investigation complete and the final response letter states due to being evidence on the pics of the house I sold (not sure if it’s allowed for them to snoop) there’s evidence of children’s bedrooms.So because I’m an actual dad to my kids and they have a bedroom at my house when they stay (which atom knew on last mortgage) they have now called me a liar and state it appears the kids live with me and if I’m unhappy with the response I will have to involve ombudsman
Geoffrey,5,Simple and easy to do,

Valerie,5,"Fast transfers, easy to see all accounts",Transfers are immediate and get a message immediately. what could be better is if we could transfer from one atom account to another (with same account owner) as when having to transfer back to external bank account it can trigger the max amount transferrable per day. Also a clearer info on the calculation of the interest rate would be helpful.

Callum P Bromley,5,First rate experience so far.,"First rate experience so far.Me and my spouse have recently moved a number of our easy access and fixed savings accounts from the ""daylight robbery"" currently taking place at high street banks to Atom. Right from establishing the accounts to managing funds within them, the whole process so far has been a breeze. The app usability and simplicity makes these transactions easy to set-up and ongoingly administer. Haven't hesitated in referring Atom to other friends and family members based on this positive experience."
MikeSheffield,3,CRAZY rules Refuse to transfer from Easy access to a fixed rate bond,Was really impressed with Atom but just tried to move £50k from easy access account to a fixed rate bond to discover can’t be done . Had online chat and told would have to move the money to the linked account then transfer it all back . CRAZY. My other bank had a daily limit and as this would have a new account number with Atom they would probably block the payments for security purposes as they have done before . So have decided to move the money to Shawbrook fixed rate they are brilliant .
Colin Monks,5,"Great app, great service, great to deal with!","I opened my first account with Atom back in October 2016 - the fact that I keep coming back as fixed savings accounts mature says it all - great app, great service and they have never let me down.

However with the building society and other bank account I also recently opened I had no such issues. When I called the atom bank they simply referred me to transunion. I have done this twice and they are extremely slow. Two weeks later and I'm still waiting to deposit because my application keeps stalling on the new address details despite the fact that all notifications of address change to all organisations have been carried out including the electoral roll! How complicated does it have to be? I hope this is not a sign of things to come.

I've lived in the same address for 30 years, have multiple bank accounts, a stocks and shares account, multiple savings accounts, and a good credit score. So I find it a bit irritating that Atom bank's app gave up so easily - apparently they only have one method for verifying who you are?Customer service was prompt, but unhelpful, saying that there's nothing they can do. I just find it odd that they have such a myopic way of verifying identity, and which no other bank/savings account has struggled with before.So I'll be taking my savings elsewhere.The app was otherwise pretty snappy, although I hate doing voice/facial recognition. And also not being able to log in through a browser is problematic - what if you lose your phone, or the app becomes incompatible with your OS - a browser portal should always be an available option."

I had to transfer the funds to my current account and then back to the fixed rate account.

Elijah,4,Good but improvements could be made,I liked being able to see the different interest options for the fixed saver I opened and could see exactly how much I would get for my deposit. Opening an account was also fairly quick but not as good as opening a current account with Monzo or Starling.I found Atom's biometric security (stored on their server) to be gimmicky and unnecessary. Being able to sign in with your phone's fingerprint is a big improvement. I much prefer the approach of other banks of a single video recording which is deleted after verification for account creation and a passcode or phone's fingerprint for sign in. Being able to use the web (on desktop) and not just a phone app would also be good.

Good app (except the face recognition, but now it supports apples face ID which is better). The app is very well put together, easy to use, and moving money in and out is simple. Best bit. The amount of interest they pay. I have an instant access saver + a 1 year lock-away plan to benefit from a higher rate. If you have money sitting in an account not earning interest, I would certainly recommend Atom. Also... phoning them better than high street banks. Very helpful."

GC,1,Unable to save with Atom if you don’t have a credit history,"Had the same issue as MM.  Tried to open a fixed term savings account but could not get past the ID verification step. It turns out that Atom uses a third party credit reference agency to perform ID verification.    If you’re in debt up to your eyeballs you’ll whizz through this step no problem at all.  If you have savings, but no credit history forget it.  I requested support via chat but was told that there’s no other way for Atom to confirm your ID other than via the credit score agency."

Taid Pete,4,Account opened - good experience,"I’ve just opened an account with Atom. The steps in opening the account are quite easy, even for an oldie like me. I thought the selfie and the voice recording ID was excellent. The security seems very good. I had tried to open an account with the Kroo bank but encountered delays and poor app, freezing. There were also many negative reviews of money transfers not being processed within a reasonable time. My experience with Atom has been good and reassuring. The site is quite easy to navigate. It is also pleasing that Atom has increased its interest rate following yesterday’s BofE rate increase. When inbound transfers are made I would like to see confirmation by text. I’ll stick with Atom and monitor how the bank will keep up with other digital banks. I’ve had no occasion yet to contact customer service, hopefully, this will add to the experience."

Michael Smith,5,Setting up account was so easy,
Nigel Lewis,5,Highly recommend 5 star …,"I found out about Atom on the Martin Lewis site as they were offering over 4% on savings, opening an online account couldn’t be easier. I highly recommend."
MM,2,Fixed Savings Account declined,"Disappointing that no feedback was available to why I was unable to open a fixed term savings account. I am trying to lock in funds into your bank rather than borrowing cash so not presenting any credit risk. Never been turned down for any account, mortgage, credit card previously before this. Maybe I’m not in debt enough. Who knows! The credit agency had all data correct also."
Keith Smith,1,Won't give info without confirmation,After setting up my registration to what may be the official app they ask for my  account number and sort code for an account of mine with several thousand  pounds in it. Bad policy for security if the want me to pay money in they give me their account number. If the app is fake they can take all my money.

GU,1,They keep spamming me despite no account.,I have asked Atom Bank multiple times to stop sending me emails.I have requested that this organisation delete all my details from their systems as required to do so under data protection legislation.They refuse to stop spamming me or comply with data protection legislation.

Johnson Vincent,5,Good banking good response,
Ultra,5,"Excellent experience, insanely seamless onboarding process","Account type: 1 year fixed rate saver.The onboarding process is a work of art and possibly the best I've experienced. I'd argue Atom even surpass Starling Bank (who themselves have an excellent mobile app).The entire onboarding process took ~10 minutes, at this point I had opened my saver account. The application prompted me to fund the account within one week, which I've now done. As a software developer, I appreciate the minimal and well thought out app design. A very slick touch is the account history tab, that now displays the amount of interest I'll collect when my bond matures in one year. Additionally, I can optionally enter details of an external bank account, where Atom will pay my interest.When signing up for the fixed rate savers, note the interest payment terms i.e. monthly or yearly. They are two separate accounts within the app. I initially missed this.After signing up I decided to test their telephone support (as Atom are 100%mobile based). To my surprise, I received an answer from someone very helpful within 50 seconds. About an hour later, my parents expressed interest in opening an account and asked me to call Atom for a second time, to query joint accounts. This time I was greeted with an automated message about high call volumes. Someone (again very helpful) answered ~2 minutes later. Very impressed.Onto the negative points :/I simply cannot get Face ID login to work on my Android phone. Password and voice work fine. I'm using Face ID for a couple of other apps on my phone without issue.Oddly, I cannot find Atom anywhere on Twitter. For an online / mobile only bank this is rather odd. Not the end of the world though.Overall, I'm very impressed, especially so with the AER :)"

Miss Nicola Christofi,2,"Great interest rate, disappointing app","Summary: the interest rate is great but the app is painful to use.I'm really disappointed in the app - I opened an instant saver based on the great interest rate. If it wasn't for the interest rate being so good I'd have given up creating an account. The onboarding process was painful and I kept running into an error page with no details as to what was wrong. I used the chat functionality to raise the issue and it allowed me to write a (long) message, but as soon as I pressed send it just cleared the message and didn't send it because it was outside of business hours. I finally got the account up and running, then a day or so ago got a notification that my latest statement was ready. When I clicked through to see the statement I got yet another error - closing the app and then going into my vault to view the statement then worked.The app doesn't fill me with confidence on how this company operates and makes me feel uneasy about putting in all of my money. They've prioritised having three ways of identifying yourself (passcode, face or voice) over some basic user journeys within the app and the customer experience. One pro to the app is that I do get instant notifications when I deposit money, which is reassuring. I'd really like Atom to focus on ironing out the bugs and give the app a better feel."

This was not necessary, instead I only needed to answer some questions about my personal finance to prove my identity. My account was opened within minutes. The app is easy to log into and easy to navigate. I had seven days from opening to pay the money into the account, this was easy to do also. Overall 10/10 for a easy experience"

Silvabod,1,Attempt to register problematical,"EDIT - have read the response (""call them"" is no answer),  Fact is, their app's ""facial recognition"" is a problem.  Sorry, nothing wrong with my camera output, it's clear as a bell on-screen.  Not prepared to run into same problem on attempting withdrawal in 12 months. As others have said, Atom registration needs work, meantime, same return is available elsewhere with far fewer problems. Lost customer !Attempt to register - unable, as the app will not accept the image it took. The facial image is 2nd step of security, the face must be in frame (obviously) but despite being perfectly clear on the tablet, in floodlight, app refuses. Since funds can only be accessed via the app (and facial recognition is security) if it eventually does take a picture, what's the chance it will, subsequently ?  So how do I access funds at redemption ?? This app needs work, I'm not alone with this thought."

P Lau,1,"Atom cost us £1,600 and we've had no compensation","I applied for a mortgage through Atom Bank (Digital Mortgages) and have had the worst experience. Our house purchase was significantly delayed (2.5 months) because Atom had issues with undertaking the mortgage survey. They sub contract that portion of their services to another organisation and have taken zero responsibility for the issues that have arisen as a result. Our mortgage survey was rescheduled 3 times by the agency they use, and the earliest appointment each time it was rescheduled was 3 weeks min. In my experience, it has never taken more than three weeks to complete a mortgage application, but with Atom it took 3 months. This delay cost us £1,600 and the only compensation we were offered was £100 which doesn't begin to cover the financial impact of the issue. Atom are now refusing to cooperate with resolving the matter. I would never ever recommend this bank to anyone."

Nick and Michelle,1,Inadequate ID check capability,"Transunion who do the identity checks for Atom are hoplessly out of date with their data and their inability to identify applicants is contributing to most of the poor Atom reviews on Truspilot, including this one. I'm not often driven to write reviews, but Atom, you need to stop putting your head in the sand over this.We want to lock some money for a rainy day into a fixed term savings account and chose Atom for the following reasons:There are other providers offering better fixed term savings, including Shawbrook and Secure Trust Bank. They also get decent reviews on TrustPilot, but we always look at the poor reviews, however good the overall score is and the other two fail dismally on customer service/communication. In the main, the poor reviews for Atom are based on their inability to verify the IDs of people looking to open an account. As you will see from their replies to other 1-star reviews, this is handled by Transunion, who's data seems to be hopelessly limited and inadequate. My wife and I have lived in the same property for 30+ years and in that time have had mortgages, bank accounts, credit cards, jobs etc. Yet still, Transunion can't ID my wife. Atom say that there is nothing they can do, but my message to them is until you do, people will take their money elsewhere, you will continue to waste potential customers' time and build up poor reviews. If we get the stock reply along the lines of: ""Sorry, we can't tell why, but we do hope you will try again in the future..."", well don't bank on it.Update after reply:Thanks for the reply, Atom Bank, but I see little point in contacting you. While I sympathise with your situation, until you change things, it is what it is. We've now invested elsewhere. The additional interest available with Atom Bank isn't worth the time and stress involved in trying to set up an account. It's eaten into by the days lost potentially trying to verify an ID, anyway. Like others have said, it shouldn't be this difficult to give you money."

Hoping someone can help.
Colin Boulter,1,Computer says no bank who  wrap staff in Bureaucratic straight jacket,This bank is all about it's own internal process and bureaucracy and the staff wear it like a straight jacket!! We have had a mortgage with them last 5 years and have an outstanding credit record and payment profile. We needed to redeem the mortgage as fixed rate come to an end. The funds to redeem was transferred to our bank account by another finance company lawyers. We sent them a completion statement to prove source of funds and they asked for a bank statement as further proof. Because it was the beginning of the month no statements available so we sent them a screen dump of our account. They said this isn't good enough because it doesn't show our name and address. But here's the rub - the account we sent the money from was the account Atom Bank have been taking mortgage payments from so they know it is our account. But no they still insisted they need our name and address on a statement. This is utter rubbish because they know it's our account. What they don't realise is it takes 20 minutes to get through to them. It take around 20 minutes to get through to our bank. So all in all I have spent many hours trying to pay them money from an account they know is ours and they have proof where the money came from in completion statement. This is another example of the moronic computer says no culture these institutions have created. When they make these rules there's no margin for anybody to use their common sense and help an honest customer simply pay off a mortgage.

Paul Dixon,1,"Should be called ""lack of"" customer support","Tried to open an account, but the app kept coming up with an error doing the address validation (I recently moved).  Called customer service, they said 'send in a utility bill'.  Did that, got an email back that said ""while it 'appears' to be an address validation, I quote, ""I'm afraid we're unable to look into exact reason why you can't get past this stage on the application, as it's an automated process and we don't do any verifications manually.""  Can't create an account, and we can't be bothered finding out why.  Fine, I'll take my money elsewhere.N.B.

Linda,5,Easy to set up,Easy to set up and pay in higher initial amount. Interest paid monthly too.

Reached out to their customer support who told us that they cannot do anything about the situation as they are using an external scoring provider. Well maybe you want to start by sorting your providers out, and god forbid insert an extra layer in your decision-making process where you could override external inputs when they clearly don't make sense."

We are ready to deposit a very large amount of money but are forced to look elsewhere. Extremely frustrating but we eventually thought if they can't be flexible and try and help us open an account we are probably better off elsewhere.We since opened an account with Investic and passed their verification no problem. We also fiund out she has an excellent credit report with Transunion so we have no idea why the atom application failed. I think they need to re-think their application process which just alienates customers.

The account was very easy to set-up and transfer cash. The face ID is a little temperamental (“your device isn’t upright”, “the lighting isn’t right”, etc…), but there are other methods of accessing the account including passcode and Voice ID. It’s reassuring that Atom was founded by Anthony Thomson and Mark Mullen who both have a great track record in the industry and that the account is protected by the FSCS, so my cash is as safe as any other regulated bank in the UK."

Louis Starkey,1,Yet another bank with zero customer service,"I tried to open a fixed term account with Atom bank today.  I was very Impressed with their one year fixed term account which was featured in the Martin Lewis money site.They tell you it only takes 10 minutes, in fact I spent almost an hour mainly with the biometric scan.  After too many restarts I managed to input this required data.   I was now just a stroke away from joining this happy Bank only to fall at the last hurdle.  They,failed me!   Not because I had a prison record, or I had just come back from Afghanistan and hadn't turned my weapon in,  no it was because they couldn't  identify me on the details that I had provided.  An 80 year old that lived at the same address for 23 years.Not being put off I engaged the chat line.  She couldn't help, said that either my address hadn't been recognised or my name or possibly I couldn't be traced through my credit score.  Either way they were not going to let me open an account. I'm glad now that I didn't continue because,if for some reason down the line their was some query as to why they weren't go to return my money and my only contact was a faceless online chat bot who couldn't help with most basic problem then I would have been in big doo doo.It seems I'm not the only person that's had this problem with credit score.  I've not required credit for the past twenty odd years so why should that effect my credit score.  And why didn't this chat bot not put me through to someone who could explain.Then to add insult to injury a smiley face waved me goodbye with ""see you later""  No you won't.   When your investing a large sum of money trust and service is essential."

vicki halford,5,Excellant Bank !,"I heard great reviews of this bank before making my choice to invest my money. Husband also uses Atom too. Really quick, easy and simple to apply, set up and use this bank. No issues at all. Definitely recommend to anyone."
S Harrison,1,Unsympathetic to customers struggling with cost of living crisis,This bank is a joke. Do not put your money in it. I am experiencing financial hardship and asked if I could access funds in a 1 yr fixed account due to mature in 3 months. Made it impossible for me. Do not care at all about people struggling during this cost of living crisis. Disgusting. Stay clear of Atom!!! I did provide sufficient evidence of being in debt but Atom wanted access to my bank statements going back 3 months. Too intrusive! They raised a complaint on my behalf. Said no grounds.Then they told me to go to Financial Ombudsman if I was not happy.

Jonathan Duffin,5,Just wished I did this sooner!,"For some reason it has taken me until the age of 32 to open a savings account, but with the current financial crisis I thought it just made sense to try and earn a little extra if I can.I found a few (not many though) with slightly better rates but with nothing but awful reviews which really put me off. I then came across Atom with good rates and even better reviews so decided they’re the ones I trust my money with.Installed the app and 4-5 minutes later I’ve got an easy access savings account set up and another minute or so after that I’ve got my savings moved over. From setting up my account to using the app it was all so simple. Why can’t all things in life be like this!!Thank you Atom. My wife is now doing the same :)"

Mr. Branden John Morris,5,I just stumbled upon atom....and with…,"I just stumbled upon atom....and with so many of us (I would presume) interest rates are a joke. My previous ISA in 2021 gave me £1.20 interest on £5500 over a year...criminal isn't it. Atom is an app bank and opening the account is just a case of answering typical bank questions. Next is 3 security phases a pin, a photo and lastly a voice ID. Basically all can be done on a modern phone. Once the account is open you get a 7 day window to deposit your savings into your account from some other account of yours. You must have online banking to do this. After the 7 days have expired you will not have access to your account for whatever period you have selected. Generally people tend to do long term so I selected 5 years. You can check on the app to see what interest you will typically earn per month. Upon set up you can either have the interest paid into another account or straight into Atom. They say that they will contact you when the term is due to expire."

Adam,1,Worrying app stability and poor customer support,"Signed up for an account, great process. Confirmed all the ID checks were successful. It asked me to add a bank account, but kept erroring saying there was a server error. The in-app chat continually lost chats and the service advisor just made random assertions. It took over an hour to achieve nothing and the chat advisor said the ID checks weren’t completed but refused to answer questions why the app said they were and the error related to a server issue. They also refused to acknowledge the problems with the chat. If challenger banks can’t get the basics right, I’m not going to trust them with large amounts of savings. Other complaints here about the app not functioning and not being able to withdraw funds are concerning."

Mr Russell,1,WARNING,"WARNING: atom bank has no cooling off period as required by UK laws distance selling regulations. Once you have deposited money into the account it's stuck there for the duration. Usually, there is a 14 day cooling off period, in fact I thought this was a legal requirement in the UK. Somehow, Atom have got around this. I had a dire change of circumstances four days after opening my account and applied to close my account only to be told that I can't. If they can get around this UK legal requirement I worry what other things they are or aren't doing?"

We had been discriminated against by most lenders due to me being a contractor and being classed as non standard income which is a disgrace. L&C found Atom for me but were pretty poor multiple mistakes and caused mortgage to be declined, then after my protests direct to the CEO of Atom he reviewed personally and we got the mortgage. L&C did continue to make mistakes and cause delays, i didnt even know my interest rate or monthly payments until after offer accepted and completion booked in, as L&C put the wrong product down and gave me incorrect illustration. Atom were very professional and applied a common sense approach not just computer says no. Cant fault them, L&C on the other hand were poor"

They mailed me with choices of withdrawal or re-investment or do nothing and we'll put it in a new account at a rubbish rate... but did not say how to make the desired action. I might have considered re-investing in a new fixed rate but they don't even bother to tell you the new rates - you have to go on their website and look it up separately. If they expend so little effort in helping customers stay with them, they are not keeping my money. Their customer services seemed equally apathetic when I spoke to them. THEY DO NOT HAVE A CLUE!130922. Atom completely missing the point in their reply to me. The first notification I received was an email, which offered no clarification about how to make the choice. Why, if the fixed rates are supposedly there to sekect dudvi not see them and a customer service agent said thatvi havecto look them up on the website.  I shan't waste more of my time listening to their defensive drivel, when they could be improving their helpfulness to customers."

A Charlton,1,They’re not a Consent To Let lender. Do not be fooled!,"Atom bank have a 5 year residential mortgage with a consent to let feature.They were happy to Consent To Let initially but did not want to renew CTL further because they didn’t want the flat rented for “too long” (?) and wanted me to move back into the property as that would make them happy!Why sell a 5 year fixed rate with CTL if you are are only allowed to use it for a year or two, but not allowed to renew because of such a vague rule?They also wanted me to evict a front line working Doctor during peak covid lock down despite being an excellent tenant to which I refused for ethical reasons.Fortunately I was well versed in the mortgage agreement and was able to use that as a means of reason, but you  can still expect a lot of emails and questions back a forth for many months if you go for this product. They sell you the product but don’t like to keep their side of the bargain.I’ve remortgaged with a “grown up” lender now and simply paid the ERC as I just want to get on with my life and look after the tenant and property."

customer,1,Although staff have always been polite…,"Although staff have always been polite and helpful.I have grave concerns regarding the safety and security due to their incompetent IT. Four months ago I discovered my fixed saver had been linked to a third party who I had no connection with or knowledge. I was assured that although this third party account was still showing they had blocked any money being transferred to it from my account. After four months I was contacted to be told the issue was now resolved and the third party account was no longer showing and was credited £50. Today I logged into my account only to find it is still linked to this third party account. This simply unacceptable, my advice if you want to sleep at night avoid Atom."

One improvement would be to allow others to also pay into your Atom savings; friends, family or freelancer employers etc  But I don't think that's possible..?"
Melanie Filbey,5,Extra account,Account easy to open and a decent rate of interest !
Ben,3,The app is very scratchy,"The app is very scratchy - UI looks good but very hard to use (lack of functionality and lots of bugs). The support chat often has issues which fails to send your messages to the support team even with a working internet connection. Also the conversation will always get cleared very quickly and you have no option to save it in case you have the same issue again. When trying to add a bank account which you can transfer your money from, the app said an error occurred (without any reasons). I have to asked the support to add it for me by emailing my tbanm statement to them which is not really practical at all. The only thing I join is that they are fscs protected and a fantastic interest rate."

Security seems to be excellent, with a choice of log in options, + you can MAKE a bit of interest. - Something the high street banks don’t like giving !!"
Duo,1,Rubbish interest rates,I echo some of the other comments. The interest rates on Atom are some of lowest around now. They don't seem to act very quick at putting them up too. Many much better options around so we have moved our money out of Atom Savings.

Paul Pearson,1,"Awful customer service, racist policies","Awful customer serviceTried to open a savings account and declined. My wife is not a British citizen and therefore not on electro roll but she is a tax payer and resident and has been for over 26yearsContacted customer service and informed the lady we want to invest a lot of money and what the problem was. Her attitude was simply ‘i can’t do anything about it go elsewhere.’ No offer to help or try to put I’d contact with anyone who could help.Having now contacted customer service, we are no further forward. In fact I would now have to say that their policies are racist. In order to pass identity checks you must be on an electoral role. To be on an electoral role you must be a UK citizen. So despite having been a UK resident for over 27years, having indefinite right to remain in UK, married to a UK citizen for 27 years, with numerous bank accounts, credit cards, NI number, NHS number, tax payer, National Insurance payer, etc etc, my wife still cannot open an account with Atom. In effect, their policies preclude anyone who is not a UK citizen. Amazed they can get away with this in this day and age. Their website states must be a UK resident. That is not correct, you must be a UK Citizen and resident."

Mr Lovell,4,My account with Atom was easy to set up…,"My account with Atom was easy to set up although I ended up depositing less than originally planned.  I chose a 6 month fixed saver account and made a small initial deposit, you have one week to make the deposit(s).  Once my original deposit went in, very quickly, I tried to deposit more but for some reason my Bank (Natwest) held the transaction suspecting fraud.  After speaking to my bank and convincing them that the deposit was my own decision and I was not being coerced I made further two deposits.  I can check my account easily and the app appears very reliable.  Because I was deterred by Natwest's apparent concerns I resisted depositing more money and kept it to around £10k.  Its early days with my Atom account and I am happy with it but the initial issue with my Bank suspecting fraudulent transactions has deterred me from making greater investment with Atom, I hope this can be resolved."

Apparently their outsourced credit checking agent (Credit Karma) couldn't ID me.  Understand that they need to check ID, but they shouldn't use a Mickey Mouse agency for the process - I'm on electoral register, have lived in same house  for over 5 years and have a credit card so they should be able to find and verify my ID. I checked my credit history with a different agency (Experian) and was given the highest rating possible by them, so there is something wrong with Credit Karma's checking process - not great away to grow your business Atom bank!"

I had to move it into my current account & then transfer it to the fixed rate acct. They tell me they are working on enabling this. Otherwise, good so far."

Paul,5,One of the biggest players in the UK banking sector.,"TBH I was unaware of Atom as a bank brand and was sceptical about their legitimacy. After some research, it's clear they are a real power to be reckoned with when you consider what's on offer in terms of savings accounts on the UK high street. Really easy to set up an account and start saving straight away. The saving products they offer are in the top 2 available in the UK. I moved from a 0.01% interest rate to 2.6 % in a heartbeat. They come thoroughly recommended!!!!"

This year account matured on 13th june , new rate of 2.3% was added (only raised to 2.3% on 7th june from previous rate ) then i find it was raised to 2.6% on 14th june and contacted them to ask why this was the case and would i get the new rate or is there a 14 day cooling off period that i could change , but unfortunately all i got was terms and conditions blah blah, Strange way to treat long term customers and for this reason they have now lost at least one ( more when i tell people of this treatment ) Strange business"

My money is now tied up for 12 months, but thereafter I will not be reinvesting...."

Sandy Robertson,4,Atom,"This has been just about the only bank I have had a great experience with. Easy to open an account in 10 minutes (the only glitch being told I needed a PIN on my phone and the message ""spoof detected"" when I took my picture!). Customer service answer emails within hours.I had horrendous issues trying to deposit money, but this was down to Halifax refusing transfers 4 days in a row, keeping me on the phone for hours before finally doing the transfer, assuring me this won't happen again, before repeating the problem next day. I'm told by Atom they've had this issue many times so I'd advise checking with your bank if they will allow you to send money to Atom before you start the process."

Alan Harle,5,Excellent in all important aspects,Excellent in all important aspects. Easy to register and open Instant Saver account. Funds transferred in appeared instantly as did withdrawals back to my bank. The app seems intuitive and clear.The rather jolly nature of some aspects within the app seem infantile for a serious bank and savings account - to be greeted by a waving hand emoji-type symbol on the accounts page and to be told ‘kerching’ and ‘on its way’ when withdrawing funds is a reason for not keeping the account open. I’m 70 and don’t need that for serious financial business. Trying too hard to be ‘fun’ I think.But absolutely no operational or transactional complaints at all. Would recommend to people with my grumpy caveat.

Mr. John Holland,5,My experience with Atom continues to be…,My experience with Atom continues to be excellent and trouble free in achieving my objectives.
Robert Gilmour,1,Heartless (even by banking standards),"I was initially very impressed with the service until an unexpected event required me to apply for an early withdrawal from a fixed saver. Atom say they will allow, under exceptional circumstances, early withdrawals with no loss of interest. I have no idea how “exceptional” they have to be as mine were very exceptional to me at the time. I always thought I could access my own money if I accepted the interest penalty. How wrong I was. They flatly refused to entertain my request so be warned. Your money is locked in no matter how dire your situation is! I Will not be re depositing my cash with this bank ever again. To be fair, it’s in their Ts and Cs and I was probably naive to expect any compassion from a bank but I still find it incredible that I can’t access my own money even if I let them keep all the interest. PS date of experience was 17th April 23 not as below."
MR RICHARD POWELL,5,Satisfied customer.,"If you are happy to do banking via your phone then atom bank is good option.

Alan Mackenzie,1,Hopeless application process,"I wanted to open a savings account. It turned into a shambles. I Downloaded the app and filled in the form. Good start …. but they said they needed more info. Turns out that their credit ref agency (Credit Karma) couldn’t identify me. That’s despite the fact I am in my 50s, have lived in the UK all my life, have lived in my current home for over 10 years (so pay energy bills / council tax) and have had countless financial service products (mortgage, loans, credit cards, current accounts…)  so to progress I was asked to post an original passport or driver licence (or a copy certified by a doctor/ lawyer/minister). What a faff. Appreciate you need to run checks/ money laundering but your credit ref agency is Mickey Mouse IMHO. Also - As an online bank why can’t you facilitate upload of documents - other organisations do it. You fell at the first hurdle. Lost yourself a customer."

Jet Defloor,4,the place for my spare cash,Just joined Atom bank a week or so ago. Really easy to set up.

Michael Dougall,5,Very simple and quick to create…,Very simple and quick to create accounts. Pays top interest rates on both instant access and fixed rate savings accounts. App.is easy to use. Only downside is that Atom is not currently part of the Bank Account Validation system so can be a bit scary when making large transfers into an Atom bank account and need to check details very carefully before submitting.
Margaret Langkey,5,So easy to use and competitive rates…,So easy to use and competitive rates for basic savings accounts. There is a selection of accounts depending how long you want to put it away.  I have done easy access and a 6 month bond as everything is changing so quickly
Sunny Singh,5,Great app,"So far so good, took about 10 minutes to open my account up via the app, have transferred money across and withdrawn money to ensure it works and it does. The app notifies you when money is transferred in. Currently gives a good rate for savings but in reality the environment means very poor interest rates are being given by banks overall so inflation is killing my savings.I have recommended Atom to some family members already and shown them how easy the app is to use."

SB,1,Atom account declined,"I applied for a Atom account, went through security checks no problem and the account was set up. My wife then did the same thing but was declined. I contacted customer services and was told that because she had a 'thin file' she was declined and that may be due to not having a mobile phone account or credit card in her name, which is because she is a named person on my accounts. So it seems that if you have no credit problems whatsoever and pay your bills on time, then you will not be able to open an account with Atom"
Drew,5,Very pleased,Was a bit iffy at first about using an app only bank but the app is really good and fast with deposits and withdrawals. A text confirmation of activity would be good if if was added. Really hope they keep competitive with the rates.
David East Midlands,5,I did not think I would ever use a…,"I did not think I would ever use a banking app on my mobile phone, but having seen interest rates slowly creeping up I happen to see Atom Bank featured on Money Saving Expert and thought I would give it a try. A bit of a delay getting the account & nominated bank account sorted (mainly due to applying for the account at the start of the weekend, and the bank account being a joint one). After waiting a couple of days is was all authorised and I transfered some money into my New Account. It is now over 4 weeks and I have not yet tried to withdraw any (so don't know how easy that will be). But overall I am please with being able to view my account easily on my mobile!"
JDP,1,No facility for joint accounts.,"I have been informed that there is no way my wife can have access to funds I deposit with Atom Bank, by way of having the account in joint names. Not having the facility for joint accounts is a serious omission and needs to be addressed ASAP."

ANTHONY O HANLON,4,"Great rate, great app, great decision","Switched from Starling who were giving me a paltry 0.05% interest to Atom where I get 0.9%. Great app, although lost a Star due to having to add a pin to my mobile which is a pain when the app is secure enough."
Jonny,5,Incredibly fast,"Very user friendly app and incredibly fast.  It makes me smile every time I make a transfer.  Just shows you how useless (out of date) most other banks' systems are.  Faster payments CAN be done in seconds.In addition, full marks to Atom Bank for being the first to increase their savings rates following the recent Bank of England interest rate increase.  They currently have the highest rate of 0.90% for easy access accounts."
Maj,5,New account,"Easy opening a new account using the app. I am a pensioner and not brilliant with the internet, but I found it really easy."
Terry Wheeler,5,Most helpful staff.,

Mr Alan Burton,5,Well thought out account opening procedure and very competitive rates,"I have opened a number of fixed saver accounts and an easy access account over the last 12 months. Rates are very competitive but simplicity of the account opening procedure and clarity of account information is a major driver for me. As a retired Bank Manager I found the account opening procedure simple and straightforward through the Atom app. Easy to transfer funds, see that they have arrived safely and a small initial payment transfer is permitted. (Don’t we all do this?)Account information on app is crystal clear. Liked the option of password, voice recognition or face recognition. Just reinvested on expiry of a fixed savings account and, once again, the choices are clear and the procedure straightforward. Have recently helped a retired friend open a fixed savings account as well."

Atom also give you a warning about transferring funds from another bank which you would hope would get easier once you have registered Atom's details to receive funds from another bank account.  My bank referred my first 2 transfers to Atom to their fraud team who were quite slow in contacting me about my transfers to Atom, but this was very comforting in a way,  It is so easy to use this App and you see all your transactions easily and transfer funds back to the account used to transfer your funds initially.  One of the best rates for an easy access savings accounts and interest is paid monthly.  I would happily recommend Atom bank to others based on my experience with Atom to date.

John Parnell,5,Good product great service,Easy peas to deal with and good product
Mike,4,Overall good product for saving.,"Atom is an app based product.  I have had a fixed one year saving account which is locked away for the year and interest is added to the account at the end of the year.  I rolled over the account for a few years and been very satisfied with the interest rate each year apart from 2021/2022, which was rubbish.The app is easy enough to use apart from facial recognition which is a bit sketchy. All in all good."
Raymond McGregor,5,Took only a few minutes to set up.,Took only a few minutes to set up.Easy app to use.Would definitely recommend.

William Burns,5,The best rates for both easy access and…,"The best rates for both easy access and fixed accounts that I could find - The APP itself is easy to set up, easy to access and easy to use - I could complete transactions easily both in and out of my nominated account. The APP facilitates everything from viewing balances and transactions to opening new accounts from beginning to completion. The speed that my transfers in and out occurred was truly remarkable compared to other savings accounts - The security is very good with the options of a passcode and biometrics - my only small issue would be my preference for fingerprint access over facial and voice recognition. Customer service is efficient, polite and knowledgeable - although it's early days for me I'm completely sold on my first APP only service - and my 'excellent' rating is absolutely justified."

Adrian,5,User friendly and secure,"Easy to use app, but importantly, very secure. The only problem I have experienced is to do with my own bank failing to recognise Atom Bank and so being reluctant to transfer the funds."
Steven,5,Great Account,Really simple process to open the account via the app and everything goes smoothly in terms of transferring funds between savings and linked account.  Have already recommended it to others.  Great stuff.  Thanks!
Mr Richard Oswin,5,I have only recently opened an Atom…,"I have only recently opened an Atom Instant Saver account and so have had little experience yet of its advantages or disadvantages but, so far, everything appears fine. In the current climate it offers a competitive interest rate for an instant access account at 0.75% and is extremely easy to use, partly due to a very clever and simple App.The Atom Bank Instant Access account certainly has plenty going for it, especially if they keep ahead of the competition with attractive interest rates."
Mr C,5,Easy to sigh up for,"Easy to sigh up for. Face recognition which I love. Best of all, the highest rate, I will stay while it is!"

Sandy B,5,Easy to set up account with good rates,I chose to set up a savings account with Atom following the recommendation on Martyn Lewis Money Saving  Expert site. I also looked at other Trust Pilot reviews. I am not the most tech savvy person but found setting up the account to be straightforward and the instructions easy to follow even the face recognition part that others had mentioned as an issue has so far caused me no problems. The account was set up quickly and my transfers in have been without issue. The account I chose was easy access and offers a far better rate than others on the higher street. Based on my experience so far I would recommend this company.

Mr Donovan,4,Atom Bank,"After initial problems on the app opening the account I posted a very critical review of Atom. However to their credit they did respond by email and on Google Play. There was also a contact number. The following day I made a further attempt to open the account and was successful. I have deposited money with no problems and the app seems to work well. You open it with either a password, face recognition or voice recognition. Personally I would have preferred a fingerprint log on. However other than that it all seems good."

NikD,1,Avoid.  App doesn't work properly.,"I had an account, but one day the app wanted a face id picture, but after hours spent trying to adjust lighting and position of my face phoned support, as nothing I did worked.  Their answer, try again later.  Didn't work.  Phoned back.  No answer available, so only option to close account.  Now that they're back at top of saving rates I decided to try again.  Failed again, but this time it turns out before that my id was part of the old system and so someone manually moved me to the new system and I was able to reactive my id.  But have now had FOUR phone calls trying to setup linked account for new savings account to Monzo, which my previous savings account was successfully linked to, but no one seems to be able to sort this out.  I've emailed bank statement from Monzo but no further communication.  Support is beyond useless for this bank.  Every conversation takes a painful 5 minutes of security questions, despite having face id and voice registered.  Surely they should be able to authenticate me instantly though the app.  All in all a really bad experience with this bank.  Seems they have run out of funding and with it any desire to make their app work properly."

Dom Reed,1,Terrible experience trying to open an account,"Terrible experience trying to open a savings account a few months back. I  was trying to connect a Starling bank account which apparently doesn't always work on the automated system. I had a live chat where the person I spoke to explained I could email a statement so they could connect it for me... BUT not if my instant saver application was in progress. However, connecting a bank account is part of the application, so I couldn’t complete my application UNTIL I added a connected account.... hence impossible. Their solution? Get a different bank account!!All in all, what should have been a great forward thinking app based account, is very poor and doesn’t use open banking, which is why it doesn’t work properly. Sadly this provider keeps coming up in account best buys and intrigues me all over again until I remember who they are. Avoid if you use starling or similar."
David,1,Yesterday I tried to open an instant…,"Yesterday I tried to open an instant access account, having read on Moneysaving expert. I got to the verification stage and kept getting thrown out due to the app not correctly recognising my address. I called and had a lengthy conversation with an advisor. Following advice from her team leader I was asked to email either a household bill or bank statement, which I did. This morning I received a reply stating ""I have updated those details for you now, so you should be able to continue in app. If you need further assistance, you can message us via live chat or you can call us on 0333 399 0050, we are available every day 8am till 8pm.""I was again unable to continue, and started an online chat with Rhys. I was advised there was nothing further could be done. I then started a chat with Heather who I asked for the complaints dept contact. She advised she would raise this on my behalf and then went on to advise that Atom advise customers to open a Credit Karma account! Why? There is no reference to this during the sign up process.All I wanted to do is open a savings account where I can deposit money.I am extremely disappointed with the utter lack of customer service."
Richard Perry,5,So far very impressed with the ease to…,So far very impressed with the ease to set up. I was with Paragon Bank for my savings and needless to say they did offer a good interest rate at the time. The main problem is an easy access savings account is supposed to be quick and easy. Sometimes I could wait a whole day or even next day to get my money with Paragon bank. Just tested this out on my new Atom account before committing to depositing more into it and the transfer was instantaneous. Bravo!
Stephen Jones,1,Plain useless,"I previously had an atom savings account a few years ago with no problems. Last night I decided to open a new savings account and went to the app. I logged in but was presented with a message saying that Atom had changed their security and I would need to call. I called and was on hold for a long time before my call was answered. I went through initial security with no problems but was then told I would need to answer some additional questions. The first was the name of the previous account I had, then the interest rate and where I had been having the interest put. I had, had the account such a long time ago that I had no clue as to these answers. Being as Atom is an online only account, I had no statements either. The advisor told me they could tell me which answers I got wrong and then I could call and try again, literally no other option. Needless to say I’ve taken my custom elsewhere, to a provider with a far better grasp of technology and security!"
Cy,5,Highly recommended - mortgage account,"Had a mortgage account with Atom for several years and everything was simple and easy. They were quick with almost everything, including the mortgage offer approval.The app is very comprehensive and everything is in one place, making it easy to manage.

The only reason I left was because I found better interest rates elsewhere, otherwise I would have been more than happy to remain with Atom."

Ian Treacher,5,Savings App You Can Trust,"Initially I went with Atom because they offered the top rate of interest for a fixed saver, knowing little about the bank at the time. I was a little apprehensive due to the fact that all transaction are done via their app but have been more than impressed with the service they offer, renewing my yearly saving account this last three years. I get my interest payed directly into my normal bank account and everything works like clockwork. I trust them with my savings and they still offer the best rates. I would highly recommend them to my friends and family."

Paul Nash,1,Beware,"Beware, this ""bank"" is not in the confirmation of payee scheme that other banks operate. I'm unable to transfer funds into the account I opened with Atom because of this. So I opened up the app on the only device I have it installed on, started a live chat with ""Rhys"" and part way into the conversation he disappeared. Next time I open up the app on the same device, it asks if I'm a new or existing customer. Existing of course. So it asks if I want a a log in code. What other choice do I have? So I get an e-mail ""So you'd like to register an additional device?"" No of course not, I want a bank that other banks recognise and an app that works.Please don't ask me to ring you on a 40p a minute  phone line, just reply to my e-mail please."

Phone calls to HMRC resulted in - contact Atom bank, they are responsible for the correction.I contacted them and received a reply around 3 weeks later to inform me the mistake had been corrected.3 months later and I’ve got a tax demand on money/interest that I’ve not had. More annoyingly HMRC have changed my tax code from April to claw it back.I wonder how much time and effort this will take for me to rectify…Update: I have been in contact with Atom Bank and they have been most helpful and sent HMRC a new interest statement.Update 2 14/04/2023:HMRC, after contacting HMRC they have found the missing the letter from Atom and have now changed my tax code... Unfortunately they added the interest instead of taking it away and taxed me on money that I have never seen again. Back to square one.I wonder how much time and effort this will take for me to rectify… 14 months and counting."

My reason for  changing to an instant access accounts is because rates are, hopefully, improving.I have found my account easy to manage on the whole. My only criticisms  are that it could be made easier to print off information ( the email link only appears on certain pages ) and that the contents of the vault are not easy to identify.I have chosen a Y"
Oliver Hunter,5,Atom Bank Review,"I have found Atom bank incredibly easy to use and would recommend them. I had a 3 year bond which did me well, I have since opened a two year bond at a slightly lower %. However there are some superb elements to Atom starting with their app, it must be one of the easiest to use and navigate in the finance sector and even forecasts for you. During the early days of the pandemic I was also allowed to take out some money from my bond as I had been made redundant, a really classy touch. I have been so impressed I’ve opened a savings account too."
Paul D,4,App is great,App is great - web chat from it is great and rates are competitive. All good - It would have been 5 stars except to move my funds from an Instant Saver to a One year fix meant I had to transfers funds back to my connected account at RBS and then go through the pain of transferring it back in tranches because of daily transfer limits on faster payments. This also led to 2 lengthy repetitive calls around fraud and to convince them I was not money laundering!! This was Manual and cumbersome and surely a fairly easy fix for a digital bank to allow me to move money between two accounts in my own name. But apart from that I love Atom - been great so far.
June Dewin,5,Well done Atom!!,"I have several accounts with Atom and have never had a problem that their team hasn't been able to resolve quickly. Account setup is very easy. All staff I have spoken to are very friendly and helpful. Interest rates are good and compare well with other banks. I like the fact that my App account is accessible from anywhere in the world, thus eliminating lengthy and costly phone calls from abroad."

Susan Abbott,1,Terms and Conditions!,I have always been totally happy with Atom until today. I started a one year fixed rate - the date to fund it closed 4 days ago. My husband’s fix with Atom finishes on Monday - when I checked the rate it had gone up by 0.35% - interest rates have been so low for so long - I was extremely annoyed. I rang Atom - that old terms and conditions clause was quoted! Sometimes I think there needs to be flexibility. Will think twice about re investing when this fix finishes Oh for a touch of humanity!
Poppy cat,5,Very good bank,"Very good bank , good rates , excellent service and back up."
Jennifer Basham,5,Happy repeat investor,"Fixed term investment matured, given lots of notice that this was happening and clear choices as to my options on maturity. Website is easy to use and this makes it simple to make and action your choice. Big plus is that the facial recognition works on this site unlike some big name competitors. My only criticism is that my bank does not recognise Atom bank and I don’t know why. I have to go through my bank’s fraud procedure when I make an investment. Not sure if this is something Atom can resolve?"

Thankfully being first time buyers we did not have a house which we needed to vacate or else we would have been homeless for two months because that's how long it took for a simple mortgage application to be processed. Absolutely shocking, no communication available and I would genuinely AVOID like the plague!  Just go for the next mortgage lender that's maybe a pound dearer, I really wish I had of."

So I called, and actually spoke to someone who advised there is no desktop app - so bear that in mind.  I needed a statement quite urgently, and he set it up as we chatted and before I knew it it was in my documents in the app.  Basically painless banking - would recommend!"

They pretend they have a customer care department but never respond to any correspondance directly. Only means is some inadequate assistant via a app chat service -  some data analyist looks at the potential impact on their business more than the customer needs. There are plenty of alternatives with a much better user interface, customer care and range of products more suited to customers requirements."
Ed Thomas,5,Very positive experience,"I used one of Atom's fixed term products and found the experience very smooth - setup was easy on the app, and I really appreciated having access to everything through the app, no need to use post or web in parallel.

David Jordan,1,Cannot recommend for mortgages,"Unsure whether it's Broker's fault or Atom's fault, but pretty sure it is the latter - having a hell of a crappy time progressing a mortgage at the moment as a valuations officer is incredibly unclear about what they want. On the third report at this point.My gut feel is the seller will pull out soon due to the delay and it'll end up at the ombudsman to get my conveyancing (and extra rent) costs back but we'll see..."

Marina,1,Impossible to open an account,I have been trying to open a saving account all day. The app does not work. I recorded my voice. There was a perfect message after each of the 3 recordings but at the end I got an error message saying to try again. I repeated the process several times without success before contacting the bank for assistance. They said there was nothing they could do and asked me to use another phone if I had one. I have given up and opened the account with another bank. Very disappointing.

Mr Peter Thorne,3,Transfer Issues from Other Banks Are a Problem,I had no issue with opening or the savings facility of Atom but transferring money in from other banks is an absolute nightmare. Neither TSB nor Lloyds recognises the sort code of Atom meaning payments to the Atom a/c are halted at base while security checks are carried out. I've spent so long on the phone this week I've decided not to pay any more in and open up a Building Society account instead. Atom need to sort this out and urgently.

Daniel Harford-Lyons,1,"Good products but rude, patronising staff and technical issues unresolved.",Facial and voice recognition login both failed multiple times. When I questioned this with Atom their response was to ask me if my finger was covering the microphone on my handset? I fail to see how this would prevent facial recognition from working. I also find the question extremely patronising and belittling. No attempt was made to diagnose any fault. Account is now closed!

Russell Hawes,5,"Exemplary experience setting up my fixed term, fixed interest Savings Account with Atom Bank","I set up a fixed term, fixed interest savings account with Atom Bank and found the whole process simple and reassuring. I chose Atom because of their attractive interest rates, and excellent customer service reviews, which I 'tested' by phoning them, twice, with questions that I might have been able to find the answers to on their website, getting through quickly, and getting excellent answers, on both occasions, and always in a friendly, professional and reassuring 'voice.' The sign-up procedure, on the App, could not have been clearer, or more reassuring, in its simplicity and clarity. They even seem to anticipate potential concerns by offering appropriate but unsolicited reassurances at timely moments. The prompt notification that my new account had been credited (from my High Street bank account) was literally 'instantaneous' arriving, in the form of a 'notification', at almost the same moment as the debited Bank confirmed the transaction from their end. Since then, notifications and account details on the Atom Bank App have been timely clear and accurate, leaving absolutely no room for doubt or concern at any stage."

One thing if they can improve on is that my bank cannot verify Atom Bank’s detail. Kept blocking my transfer initially. Hope this can be sorted in the near future.

HanniszeY,5,Excellent experience in opening FD account,"I opened a FD account with Atom recently, but because I had previously banked with them many years ago, I was encountering a little problem in setting up my account on its App initially. I sent an email to them, which was promptly replied, asking me to call instead, for security reasons. I called, and didn't have to wait very long to be connected to a staff who very quickly fixed the issue. My account was up within minutes, and I like the fact that I received an email confirmation informing me that my account is opened, with the details of my new account. Call me old-fashion, but I feel safer to have this confirmation to prove the existence of my account in an App-based only bank like Atom. So, overall, my experience with Atom has been good this time (and the last, a few years ago!)"
Terence Smith,4,Easy to use with good interest rates.,Easy to use with good interest rates.Only drawback is you cannot transfer funds between accounts online. Have to withdraw and pay back in.

Suehew,5,MSE reccomended,"i saw a savings plan for Atom bank on MSE and decided to invest a small amount for 1 year.So easy to navigate their site, all very clear-and quick."
Gustav,3,"Good, unless you make ""too many"" overpayments","The good:I have mostly had a positive experience from the inception of our remortgage application to the use of the app.  Turnarounds are quick and everyone we have dealt with was great.The bad: We have been making overpayments every month since the inception of our mortgage.  With it not being the same amount every month it is not something we can automate.  Making an overpayment is quite a convoluted process as you have to either contact the bank via chat or call to get a quote.  Only once you have received a quote can you make the overpayment.  The ugly:The reason for the 3 stars is that we have now been asked for proof of funds for two months in a row when making the overpayment.  The lady I spoke to said that after a certain number of overpayments you get ""flagged"".  It looks like I will now be asked for proof of funds with every overpayment I make.  This is just adding to the pain of an already convoluted process.  It looks like a deliberate extra hurdle to discourage you from making overpayments."

Alan,5,Savings Accounts,Easy to open savings account and keep watching for competitive interest rates.
Jane,3,Opening an Atom account,Opening an Atom account was easy and this was the first time I had completed a process like this. Tranferring money was a problem as the bank was not registered with UK bank secure system. The result was my bank flagged up the payment as not secure to be sent. Eventually I decided to send a small amount of money £10 and was contacted that this was not enough money to open the account. I therefore sent £50 which opened the account. By the time I had gone through this process I was timed out to putting money in the account and a £500 payment was flagged up by the fraud department at my bank and after my explanation the money was recredited. Until Atom Bank signs up to the banks secure system customers like me will find transferring money a little problematic. I feel the principal is good but fraud in banks is such a huge problem they are treating transations very carefully. Atom needs to join the Banks secure system to avoid questions.

Alan Keen,5,I chose Atom for a savings account because I wanted it to be hassle free. It was.,"I chose Atom for a savings account because, although it didn't offer the highest rate, it was higher than most and had more positive reviews on Trustpilot and fewer negative comments than some others offering higher rates. I was particularly concerned to avoid banks where a significant minority of customers had experienced technical problems with opening the account and with depositing and withdrawing money, all even more important for a bank with no branches. I was not disappointed. The process of opening the account and funding it was as smooth as can be and I feel secure knowing that nobody can log in to my account via a web browser. It only works via the phone app and I log in using face recognition, which has worked without problems every time. I'm very happy so far."

customer Ian M,5,My attention was drawn to Atom Bank…,My attention was drawn to Atom Bank because they were offering market leading savings rates. I then discovered that you could only apply for and run the accounts via an app. This initially put me off but I decided to give it a try and downloaded the app. At this point I discovered just how easy it was to open the savings accounts and within twenty minutes of down loading the app I had opened two accounts and had transferred money into both of them by faster payments from my current account. Checking the app showed that the transfer was immediate. Very impressed.

Linda Holland,4,A good experience,The Atom app is very easy to use and opening a new account was quick and easy.  The only reason for a 4 rather than a 5 rating is the layout of the account summary where multiple accounts are grouped and therefore not easy to spot.

ManicConsumer,5,Some of the best rates available at the…,Some of the best rates available at the moment and easy to set up the account. One suggestion: They do not allow a transfer of less than the minimum balance of a savings account (in my case £50).  As the bank is flagged as not being able to be auto checked by the sending bank I wanted to do a smaller transfer first to ensure the details were correct and the transfer worked.  This was not possible as Atom rejected the payment.  Any amount should be allowed and if the minimum balance was not reached by the closing date the amounts could then be transferred back to the originating account.

Fred Ruddick,4,A new venture for my savings that’s worked out well,"I started an Atom bank account because they offered a much better interest rate than high street banks. Having a lump sum that I did not need to touch for a couple of years meant interest was one of the best on the market. I must admit there was some anxiety about transferring money to an on-line only account, even though I’d read about Atom before investing and their security arrangements. My concerns were alleviated once I accessed the account and received messages from the bank welcoming me as a new customer. My wife has now also opened a 2 year fixed saver, once I’d tested the water."

The only issue is with my linked account (RBS) who don’t appear to recognise it and every time I open a new account, I’ve had a hold put on the transfer until the fraud team call me, but this I would guess is a problem with RBS and not Atom"

The account opening process was quick and simple. I was asked to provide a Passcode, Face ID and Voice ID (the latter being a first for me) to enable me to access my account via the Atom App and it lets me choose whichever one I prefer to use each time I want to log in, giving me great peace of mind that my hard earned savings are safe from fraudsters.

It is very easy to set the account up and transfer the money in from my Current Bank Account.There is one thing I am quite annoyed about though, otherwise I would have given 5 stars.  Within a week or so of me transferring the money into the account, the Interest rates went from 1.22% to 1.50%. I do think I should have been informed that the interest rates were to be increased soon.  I actually did speak to a couple of staff members about my account before transferring the money and not once was it mentioned.  I thought staff were to help and advise customers? I would have waited a week to transfer the money to the new account. I would definitely think about not saving with Atom again because of that."

Gawler,5,Good experience,"Good experience I have had several accounts with Atom over the past few years and am very happy with them.I like the fact that I can chooses face recognition or use a passcode to access my account and in the main the site is easy to navigate.The option of a 7day window in which to invest money after opening a savings account is a good idea, giving me time to move money between accounts if I choose.Always clear and prompt emails stating when accounts are maturingThe only negative is that I do not like the way all documents are stored in a ‘vault’ and find it very trying when I want to review my history/transactions.Currently Atom are offering one of the top interest rates on savings and I am more than happy with the service"
Phillip Salt,5,Effortless,Transferred funds into a new fixed saver. Effortless process and a reasonable rate of interest. Been with Atom several years now and always receive a first class service.

Phill Bonham,5,Straight forward online Bank.,Simply put it’s a good straight talking bank. I’ve only saved with them but interest rates are fair sometimes really good but in the present climate much as you’d expect. Was a little uncertain about an online only bank but I’ve found it really easy to set up savings accounts and transfer money. Don’t be in any doubt they are a good bank with a phone number to speak to a  live voice/person!In the few years with them Ive never had cause to complain and I’m a grump sole.

Elaine Parry,5,Loving Atom,"I've saved with Atom for a number of years now using their fixed term savers. The interest rates have been excellent and even though rates have plummeted I've chosen an instant access saver following the maturing of my last fixed as their rates are still very competitive.I've love their banking app, so easy to use. All information accessible, security great and there's also access to someone via phone if needed.Brilliant."

John Grierson,5,Instant Saver Account,"Found the app easy to use. Created an instant savings account in no time, linked to my bank account and transferred some money over very quickly.Rates are competitive, might even open a fixed term account."
Colin Bray,5,"Competitive interest, easy app, reassuring security","I've only just opened my account after being tempted by the very competitive savings interest rate - and, so far so good. It was very easy to set up arrange transfers. I like how there's a restriction to one other bank account to transfer in and out of. And the interface is clean, clear, simple and elegant."
Daniel Upcraft,5,Easy to use and set up,
Neil,4,Eearning no interest on my money…,"I was earning no interest on my money sitting in a normal bank account, Atom was from my research the best option for me to earn some interest on my money. The fact that I can do everything through the app on my phone was a big draw for me. The only thing I would like to change is how they title the various documents they put into my vault especially the account statements so that I can know at a quick glance what it is without having to go into it.Understand that the money put into a fixed saver is kind of stuck there for the period you choose, so make sure you don't leave yourself without access to money for emergencies."

Of course, but at least you beat most banks, including my own, hands down. I hope to have many years of saving with you, good luck for the future. Thanks again."
Mrs wilson,5,new saving account with atom,"Does what it says on the tin, easy to set up easy to add funds, so so far so good."
Diane Worrell,5,Quick and Easy,"I learned of Atom on the Martin Lewis website and I opened my Atom savings account over the late May 2021 Bank Holiday weekend. The information available on the website was easy to understand and the process to open and manage the account is very simple. The current interest rate on the instant access savings account is fifty times the rate that I was getting on my cash ISA. I liked that I could open the account quickly and efficiently online, without actually visiting a bank or making a call. It's early days, but I am very pleased with my experience so far."
sjh19,5,I would recommend,"Just renewed my annual fixed deposit. Similar to when I set it up, super simple and great rates. I would definitely recommend."
Fiona,5,"Nice app, easy to use","From start to finish an easy process to set up a fixed term savings account.Very pleased so far - was a bit worried when I read all the 21 May reviews so hopefully they have sorted out their ""bad news"" comms if there is an issue in the future?Nice app, easy to use. My £s are locked up til next May - will review again when I know how easy it is to get the money out!"

Rowena Stephenson,5,now opened 2 different accounts,"I've actually now opened 2 different accounts with Atom as the process opening the first went so well.All seemed to be quite simple, the only slight glitch is that Atom can't be checked by other banks when you sort out your transfer. But I quickly got through to the helpline who confirmed this, and the transfer of funds was almost immediate. Very good interest rates which was my main reason for opening. The app seems very clear and all the info you need is available.My husband saw how easy it was and has opened an account too! He's the most inert person ever when it comes to moving banks."
Arch,5,Opened a fixed rate savings acc with…,Opened a fixed rate savings acc with great ease and efficiency. Impressed with the security set up. Would highly recommend

Peter,5,I signed up to Atom because they…,"I signed up to Atom because they offered a very good fixed interest deal. Slightly wary at first about using a new name, the online app reassured me over customer security. Very easy to deal with at the end of the account making it simply to transfer to a new savings account with them"
D.J,4,Competitive interest rates and excellent service overall.,Very swift deposit and withdrawal transactions supported by useful text messaging. The app is really easy to use and regularly updated with account information. The current interest rates for the fixed rate saving accounts are very competitive with an opportunity to pay in funds up to a week. Unfortunately funds cannot be transferred from an instant saver account into a fixed rate saver. Money has to be paid into and out of a nominated current account. It would be good to be able to transfer funds to another new Atom fixed rate account paying a higher interest rate within a one or two week period. Overall very pleased with Atom Bank.
Mrs reeves,5,Very easy to open new account,

Anne Kaye.,5,Recommended.,Very easy to set up and all the security features are very reassuring. So far so good.
Lance Gordon,3,"Not bad, decent rate","Setup process isn't too bad, but mandatory use of biometrics to register may not be for everyone. Once setup the app itself is nicely designed. They do not currently support open banking which is a real shame considering they are an APP based bank as this means their accounts cannot be linked to any personal finance apps like Yolt or Money Dashboard. Only real draw for me was the fact that are offering the market leading rate on easy access savings at time of opening."
Walter Mckeown,5,Have saved with atom before,Have saved with atom before had no problems paid out on maturity very pleased

Alexander Titov,4,Very good rates (the best around,"Very good rates (the best around, really) and very easy to set up. In fact, it's too easy to set - all checks are done instanteniously online and the account opened in minutes. I would like to have some documents confirming that everything is in order. There are general T&C in the Vault, but all I had was email with the new a/c number and sort. Feels very flimsy esp when you're tranferring large sums to deposit with Atom.And I'd love to have a web site version in addition to the app though...Having said that, the actual process of opening the account is very simple and quick, the rates are great, so there's little to complain about :)"
Safdar Shah,4,Opening of account at Atom Bank,"I opened my account with Atom Bank, which was quite straightforward and without any hassle. I wish Atom Bank all the success for the future.However, since Atom Bank has no ‘Payee Check’ facility like other main stream banks, we face great difficulty when transferring money from other banks to Atom Bank. It would be really appreciated if Aton Bank take on Payee Check facility like other banks as soon as possible  in order to avoid inconvenience, which customers are facing at the moment."
Manoj Sudra,5,Very easy to open an account and also…,Very easy to open an account and also strong customer authentication in place for added security and easy to follow steps.Competitive rates.
Simon Fielder,4,So far so good but it’s early days,"So far so good but it’s early days. I don’t like the way the app has its own version of Face ID rather than use using the functionality an iPhone already has in place. Surely using the inbuilt function this is easier, cheaper and more secure than developing your own version. The opening of account process was straightforward as was the transfer from my existing bank account. Atom noted that when you transfer to them most providers don’t recognise their details and they need to address this asap to provide confidence when you are transferring potentially quite large sums."

Customer,4,Overall very happy,"Overall very happy. Easy to set up accounts, and interest rate as good as you'll find. The app has a slightly annoying front page you need to click through to access your account, and I'd like there to be an option for fingerprint login, but otherwise an excellent place to store your cash instead of your current account."
Mrs Lynne Lord,5,Chose Atom because it was the best easy…,"Chose Atom because it was the best easy access interest rate around at the moment.

Customer,5,Would highly recommend - I've been saving with them for a few years and wouldn't go anywhere else.,"I've been using Atom for a few years now for savings, and I'm now unlikely to go anywhere else now. The interest rates are highly competitive, the set up of a new account is so quick and easy and the customer service is great. I've just set up a new savings account as one of my others matured, it took me less than 10 minutes! Of course the interest rates have now dropped but they have everywhere due to covid and although Atom's might be just a tiny bit lower than other banks, for the ease of it, it's worth getting an account with Atom. I also love the fact its all online. It's very secure and you don't have the hassle of going to the bank!"

So different to the cumbersome steps offered by high street banks, I even read the T&Cs for the first time ever! Day-to-day usage of the account is also a breeze and couldn't be simpler, although it is app-only.Some minor suggestions/criticisms: I don't see why the app can't use the phone's default biometric sign-in method and the vault get's pretty cluttered with statements and the rest, maybe if it was organised by document type?But y'all offer a great service which is honestly a joy to use, well done!"

Whilst atom bank at the time were not offering the best savings rate, the app was very straightforward and fully accessible to the Blind And Visually Impaired. There was just one area in the security section where it was required for the iPhone to take a facial photograph, that proved to be a bit tricky, but I was able to manage it in the end. Now the account is up and running, it is very easy to access. At the same time, I looked at the Moneybox app, but it was not accessible to blind people. Many could learn from atom bank."

Marina Buraga,1,"Unfortunate situation with a mortgage, no help from Atom and bad customer experience","Had an unfortunate experience with a personal mortgage. I have bought a 5-year mortgage with Atom in 2017 for the flat I lived in. In 2019 I moved in with my boyfriend and asked for a consent to let (CTL) which is now coming to an end.My tenant, who is financially secure and works in the big 4, will now have to move out in June, as Atom is refusing the extension of the CTL and is not offering me any other options. The result may be that I still have to pay part of the rent for my partner's place at the same time as paying mortgage for the flat that I no longer live in, or pay an exit fee and go with another provider. The exit fee for the mortgage is £4k, and Atom doesn't offer any buy-to-let mortgages for me to switch to. I have suggested reducing the amount of debt to reduce risk for them (my property also increased in value substantially, so the loan to value ratio is below 30%). There is no risk for Atom at all.It is a shame, as I enjoyed working with them up until that point. It is likely I will switch to another provider as it doesn't make sense for me to stay with Atom due to their inflexibility. Would not recommend if there is ever, even a remote chance, of you needing to rent your place out. Also - Atom bank has been suffering losses for the last two years (check their financial statements), so please be careful with investing with them - chances are they are forcing me to pay them the exit fee to improve their financial position given the Covid19 crisis which would result in even more losses for them, and they might be doing it with other customers as well.Update: I had a chat with Leanne, who stated that it is my own fault for moving in with my husband in a different property and I knew the terms of the mortgage before I signed them, and that it is clear to her I just don't want to pay the £4k. She refused to talk to my husband who was next to me, saying that she talked to me up until now, and she sees no reason why my husband has to be involved - and asked me whether I am unable to have my own conversations. I found her to be very mean and unfriendly, like I was just being greedy and didn't want to happily give them 4 grand, and that I shouldn't have my husband helping me during a difficult conversation. Which is totally true - I don't want to give away £4k for nothing - who would, especially during the Covid 19 crisis, when you have no idea what will happen?!.. And I know for a fact that most other companies do extend their CTLs in such circumstances, especially if the risk to them is low (which it is). For the latest encounter, I will lower my rating to one star, and will definitely avoid Atom bank in the future."

JILL,5,Easy as £1 £2 £3,Had some money to put away for a Rainey day. ☔️ went on all money saving £££ apps.  I found ATOM - great app - able to work out easily different amounts of money over different terms.  Made it simple for me and very easy to set up account.  After depositing the money I got a text straight away notifying me of my bank exchange.  The app is on my phone I have face recognition and I feel very happy.I was against mobile banking at my age always used to face to face customer service.  I feel very confident with ATOM and my new way of banking is so much easier from my armchair especially in these Coro I ious days.  Go for the leap it’s easy and quick.
tony,5,Straightforward to set up,"Straightforward to set up. Good communication link, all in all quite impressive."
Brian Baker,4,Face Recognition,The only problem I have is the bespoke face recognition is a bit hit and miss and sometimes can take quite a few attempt to get it to work. It would be better if they used the built in face id on the phone as all other banks do.

This is how banking should be done fast easy yet secure. Within minutes I'd opened a new savings account and my money had been transferred earning a better interest rate than almost everywhere else."
Michael Laycock,4,I have used Atom and generally been…,"I have used Atom and generally been very happy with. However, I think the 3 day option prior to maturity is not sufficient time to make a considered choice. If during this period you are abroad you are unable to use the app what can you do. Also the wording of a text received is misleading as it states your maturity options are available on the date of maturity and not 3 days prior. I have mentioned these problems previously which would be looked into but no update."

David S - London,4,"Great savings rates and ""current""…","Great savings rates and ""current"" method of dealing with a bank i.e. via an App rather than online or in person. The only reason i haven't given 5 stars is because the operation of the App is so innovative, it does take quite a bit of getting used to. It doesn't use menus in the same way as you might expect so tend to have to search around more to find what you want.Nevertheless, I have renewed my investment this year so it must be alright."
John,5,Brilliant customer service.,Brilliant customer service.I opened an on-line saving account. After a change of phone I had trouble logging in. Their help desk operator was wonderful Because I hadn't got my logon details she couldn't give account details but talked me through their system even helping me master my updated Android version from her experience with her own phone.Problem solved without exchanging any personal data either way. Absolutely perfect.
Steve Beaton,5,So Easy.,We took out a 12 month investment last year after a lot of research. It really is as easy as it looks.

It's efficient.  It's unobtrusive.  It's simple and streamlined.  The information I need is literally at my finger tips.  And so far it has caused me no problems whatsoever!"

Rahim Chitalya,1,Opened a 1-year savings account,"Opened a 1-year savings account.  Whilst the interest rate was clearly stated as fixed the restriction on further deposits is hidden away on the web site (rather once you select the product you have to go to the definitions tab where it's stuck in the middle of the second paragraph).  They do also mention this on their main page if you scroll past the products, but frankly I challenge anyone to go 4-5 pages past the product they are interested in and read the rest of the web site!  Such a key aspect of the product should be clearly listed.I also asked whether they could switch me to another account which allowed future pay in as I wish to invest but that was not possible.So called them to cancel since there is a 14-day cooling off period for all online services only to be told they don't have this.  I'm pretty sure they will relent since this is a central part of the 2014 consumer contract legislation however is frustrating when organisations feel they can just ignore the law.  Default 1-star review for such organisations.Frankly at this point they could offer the best rate in the world, I won't ever use them again.Edit: In response to the Atom feedback:From the Citizens Advise Website (CAB):""14 days is the minimum cooling-off period that a seller must give you. Make sure you check the terms and conditions in case they’ve given you more time to change your mind - many choose to do so.""Am confused, either the CAB is wrong or you are ignoring the law?  What am I missing?Opening an account does not seem to fit into any of the exemptions listed by the CAB."
ken freer,1,Had a fixed 1 year saver account and…,"Had a fixed 1 year saver account and when it came to the end they dropped the rate for the next year, after just over a week later they put the rate up for new savers. They must have known they were going to increase the rate at the time I invested but their attitude has been tough luck you are stuck on the old rate, instead of thanks for being a valued customer we are moving you onto the new rate.I wont be using them again, sharp practices do not get you a loyal customer base."
N Salmon,3,Facial recognition software doesn't work.,The fact that facial recognition software is not widely used for banking authorization probably tells you all you need to know. It's unreliable and therefore extremely annoying!
